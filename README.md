# Master project
This repository contains some of the code utilized in my master project.

### Data retrieval scripts
Utilized MadrigalWeb's Python API to retrieve EISCAT VHF and UHF data. Developed in August 2025, 
but requires bugfixes due to MadrigalWeb's update in Sep 2025.

### Model utility
Contains some of the utility used for developing and training a fully connected neural network
on UHF data. 

### Physics utility
Contains some of the utility used for calculating conductances and Joule heating rates based on 
predicted electron density profiles from UHF and VHF data.
