# Master project
This repository contains some of the code utilized in my master project.

### Data retrieval scripts
Utilized MadrigalWeb's Python API to retrieve EISCAT VHF and UHF data. Developed in August 2025, 
but requires bugfixes due to MadrigalWeb's update in Sep 2025.

### Model utility
Contains some of the utility used for developing and training a fully connected neural network
on UHF data. 

### Physics utility
Contains some of the utility used for calculating conductances and Joule heating rates based on 
predicted electron density profiles from UHF and VHF data.

### NOTE
This repository does not contain the applications of the scripts as they require datasets which are too big to upload here. 
All information about how to reproduce results from my thesis is described in the thesis.
